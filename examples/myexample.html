		<h1>Alternative Opt-in</h1>

		<p>
			So using the JavaScript API (<a href="http://cookieconsent.insites.com/documentation/javascript-api/">JavaScript API</a>) I have created an
			alternative Opt-in. Please note this is a rough example and could (a) be enchanced and cleaned up and (b) probably added back into
			the original library as an alternative Opt-in method.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The Opt-in that comes with <a href="http://cookieconsent.insites.com/">Cookie Consent</a> is good and works. This is what it looks like:

		<p>
			However looking to use it with the GDPR changes and I believe it will not fit. The changes note that there needs to be a clear way to change 
			your mind about cookies so	you can easily enable or disable them. The current way to change your mind, shown below, automatically revokes
			your choice when you click it. What if you were just looking to see what you selected, too bad all your settings have just been revoked! 
		</p>
		<img style="width:180px;" src="images/revoke.png" />
		<p>
			I have created an example that I believe fits the requirements. So what are the changes I have made in my example? Firstly I have replaced 
			the dismiss button with a deny button. In other word it is no longer allow or ignore/dismiss but allow or deny so visitor has to make a choice
			and we do not assume anything. I have changed the default wording slightly as I believe essential cookies are still allowed (I might be wrong!). 
			The buttons, allow and deny now highlight which option you have selected (see below).
		</p>
		<img style="width:100%;" src="images/settings_alt_1.png" />
		<img style="width:100%;" src="images/settings_alt_2.png" />
		<p>
			Once an option is selected there is a pop up, the revoke button, that lets you change your choice (see below). I have overridden the code for this so that
			cookies are <strong>NOT</strong> deleted when you click it but that it simply display the selection bar showing your current choice. If decline 
			is selected all current cookies are deleted unless you have deemed them essential (array in the code for that).
		</p>

		<p>
			I am not a GDPR expert, this is my understanding. It is down to you to check it covers the requirements.
